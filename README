LinkPeelr is a simple utility built with Google App Engine. 

Main ideas:

 - primarily for links hidden behind URL shorteners, 
 - also for links behind redirects
2) Works on any site
 - as a Chrome extension
 - as a Firefox plugin
3) Lets me learn the tech
 - Clean web design (jQuery, JavaScript-ed UI, Illustrator)
